    <p>FOURTH ACT</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p><span id=stagedirection>[_Lying on sofa_.]</span>  How can I tell him?  I can’t tell him.  It would kill me.  I wonder what happened after I escaped from that horrible room.  Perhaps she told them the true reason of her being there, and the real meaning of that—fatal fan of mine.  Oh, if he knows—how can I look him in the face again?  He would never forgive me.  <span id=stagedirection>[_Touches bell_.]</span>  How securely one thinks one lives—out of reach of temptation, sin, folly.  And then suddenly—Oh!  Life is terrible.  It rules us, we do not rule it.</p>   
        <span id=stagedirection>[_Enter_ ROSALIE _R._]</span>
    <h5 class=ROSALIE>ROSALIE:</h5>
        <p>Did your ladyship ring for me?</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p>Yes.  Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere came in last night?</p>
    <h5 class=ROSALIE>ROSALIE:</h5>
        <p>His lordship did not come in till five o’clock.</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p>Five o’clock?  He knocked at my door this morning, didn’t he?</p>
    <h5 class=ROSALIE>ROSALIE:</h5>
        <p>Yes, my lady—at half-past nine.  I told him your ladyship was not awake yet.</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p>Did he say anything?</p>
    <h5 class=ROSALIE>ROSALIE:</h5>
        <p>Something about your ladyship’s fan.  I didn’t quite catch what his lordship said.  Has the fan been lost, my lady?  I can’t find it, and Parker says it was not left in any of the rooms.  He has looked in all of them and on the terrace as well.</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
    <p>It doesn’t matter.  Tell Parker not to trouble.  That will do.</p>
