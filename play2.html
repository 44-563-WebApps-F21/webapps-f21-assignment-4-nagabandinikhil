    <p>FOURTH ACT</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p>LADY WINDERMERE. <span id = stagedirection>[_Rising_.]</span>  She is sure to tell him.  I can fancy a person doing a wonderful act of self-sacrifice, doing it spontaneously, recklessly, nobly—and afterwards finding out that it costs too much.  Why should she hesitate between her ruin and mine? . . . How strange!  I would have publicly disgraced her in my own house.  She accepts public disgrace in the house of another to save me. . . . There is a bitter irony in things, a bitter irony in the way we talk of good and bad women. . . . Oh, what a lesson! and what a pity that in life we only get our lessons when they are of no use to us!  For even if she doesn’t tell, I must.  Oh! the shame of it, the shame of it.  To tell it is to live through it all again.  Actions are the first tragedy in life, words are the second.  Words are perhaps the worst.  Words are merciless. . . . Oh! <span id = stagedirection>[_Starts as_ LORD WINDERMERE _enters_.]</span></p>   
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LORD WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p><span id = stagedirection>[_Kisses her_.]</span>  Margaret—how pale you look!</p>
    <h5 class=LADYWINDERMERE>LADY WINDERMERE:</h5>
        <p>Yes.  Have you found out at what time Lord Windermere came in last night?</p>
